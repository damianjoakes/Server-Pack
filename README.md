# ServerPack
Message me with your username for the IP (so I can whitelist you), don't want to include it publicly on GitHub.

### To install (requires CurseForge): 
1. Click the Code button and select "Download ZIP". (You might have to unzip the file, then zip the contents of the folder inside of it back up, for some reason GitHub automatically sticks the files into a subfolder when it zips them.)
2. Open CurseForge.
3. Select "Create Custom Profile" at the top. Then, click "Or **import** a previously created profile.

This will install the pack.  

### Known Bugs 
- Biome Blend causes weird graphical glitches. If some blocks are invisible and chunks are see through then disable biome blend.  

*Apparently [this](https://modrinth.com/mod/rubidium-aether-chunk-fix-1.19.4/version/0.6.4-dev-8.28.23) fixes it. Drop this in your mods folder after install. This is client side so don't worry about server incompatibilities.*
